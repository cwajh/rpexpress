It is the opinion of the site's administration that fandom RP is fair use under US copyright law.

It's noncommercial.
It's transformative, creating something significant that wasn't there before.
It's no substitute for the original works, and can even serve to draw a new audience to them.

But we're not lawyers, so we're not qualified to give you legal advice.
And we don't have a legal defense fund like the OTW does.

So please understand that you're taking on a certain amount of risk here.
