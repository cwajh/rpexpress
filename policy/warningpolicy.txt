It is site policy to require warnings for certain kinds of content.
This - like all site policy - is an attempt to mitigate harm.
Certain topics are especially likely to reopen old wounds.
Certain topics are especially likely to attract negative outside attention.
If we clearly mark such content, the site can be careful about who sees it; that way, the risk is mostly mitigated.

In order for required warnings be useful, they need to have a consistent meaning.
There's some disagreement within the RP community as to how terms like "non-con" or "underage" should be defined.
/It is site policy to define them broadly./
We do this because warnings are tools to minimize harm, not a mark of shame.
If they're tools to minimize harm, they've got to make sure that the content which *needs* to carry the warning, *does*.
Even if it means that a lot of the gray area is caught too.
If you think the warning is misleading, you can provide extra context in your warning notes.
If you think the warning would spoil a twist, you can mark it as such, and the site will be careful about how the warning is displayed.
But the presence of the warning itself is non-negotiable.

Also, as a reminder: there is a global ban on content that is illegal or probably illegal for us to host.
Warnings can't mitigate legal risk.
