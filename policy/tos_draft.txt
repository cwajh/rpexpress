==TOTAL LACK OF WARRANTIES==

This site is provided "as is". In other words:
* It might not meet your use case or your expectations.
* It might not be accurate or reliable.
* It might be unavailable, buggy, or slow.
* Security breaches might occur.
In other words, while we *want* to make this a useful venue, we can't *promise* you much, and we aren't making any sort of warranty.
Let's repeat that: the site has no warranty of any kind, explicit or implicit.
* There's no warranty that the site will even do the basic job it claims to do.
* Nor be fitting for any particular purpose.
* And we're explicitly disclaiming any other warranties you may have assumed were in effect.
To the extent that there's risk, you need to accept that risk - and responsibility for recovering from it - yourself.
You need to agree that you won't hold us liable if:
* Something about the site causes you damages or harms you (even if we knew those damages were possible).
* Someday you can no longer access it.
* You get in trouble for your use of the site or for the stuff you post here.
If you're taking legal risks by using our site, sorry, but you need to agree to face those risks alone.

==RIGHTS TO CONTENT==

In order to make the platform work, we take user posts and repackage them for others to see. In order to do that, we need certain legal rights.

If you want to post content on this site, you must agree to give us a world-wide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to make that content 
available. That includes distributing, reproducing, performing, displaying, and compiling, plus modifying and adapting the content's format, 
presentation, and metadata.

We intend to give you some control of how your content is presented by default, but we will also give other users control of how content is 
presented to them; your control isn't absolute.


==YOUR PRIVACY==

We collect info about the computers that visit our site, so that we can fix problems and get an idea of who (in general) is using the site.

We collect info that you upload, so that we can display it to other users, moderate, get in touch with you, and make the site work.

We use cookies to remember user log-ins and settings.

==MISCELLANEOUS==

Don't use this site to do anything that's illegal where you live, nor illegal where we live (California, USA).

Don't use this site if you're under 13. There's legal reasons for this - strict requirements for how websites have to treat people under 
13, which would be too hard for us to implement.

A link to something from this site doesn't imply that we endorse that thing or have anything to do with it. This should be common sense.

Please understand that, while we intend to excise harmful content, we aren't taking up an obligation to do it; we reserve the right to moderate
(or not moderate) however we wish. We don't pre-screen content, so there's no certainty that harmful content will be excised before you have a
chance to see (& be harmed by) it. Sorry.
