This project uses ODB.

ODB's licensing scheme is kind of weird.

You can use it under the GPL.
Or, they'll give you a permissive license for use cases where ODB's output is < 10000 LoC.
Or, you can buy a license.

I'd rather license my code more broadly than the GPL for now.
Thus: I'm enforcing the <10000 LoC restriction so that YOU can request a permissive license from ODB if you so choose.
