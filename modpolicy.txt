We are not defining law; we reserve the right to moderate, or to refrain from moderating, however we wish.

Rather, here is the spirit of the law â€“ the principles which we hope will guide us.

If you harm others in this venue by accident, we will give you the benefit of doubt and the opportunity to learn.
	But after a certain point, a lack of progress at avoiding accidental harm can only be called negligent.
If you harm others in this venue out of negligence, we will sternly remind you to pay proper attention.
	But after a certain point, a lack of progress at avoiding negligence can only be called deliberate.
If you deliberately seek to harm others in this venue, you /may/ be given one warning as an act of unearned mercy.
	But after that point, deliberate harmfulness requires that we excise you, if for no other reason than as a matter of public health.

Individual 1:1 and "Q&A" spaces are under the control of their authors, who are free to make rules of their own. We encourage you to construe these rules as the author's personal boundaries, and to disengage (stop interacting, and block further interaction if needed) if they're rules you can't accept. Of course, if harm is occurring regardless of those options, the situation can be reported for us to step in in an administrative capacity.

Individual communities are under the control of their directors, who are also free to make rules of their own. We encourage communities to self-govern in a spirit of goodwill to all (where "all" explicitly includes victims of any trouble caused by community members). We hope that we do not have to step into communities in an administrative capacity, but we reserve the right to do so should our own principles require it.

Finally: in order to protect ourselves and the existence of this venue, we also intend to excise anything we suspect is illegal for us to host, whether or not we consider it harmful in and of itself. Flaunting this will be construed as harm to the viability of the site itself - accidental, negligent, or deliberate, as appropriate.
